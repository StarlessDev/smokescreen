# Smokescreen
A simple CLI utility to manage Cloudflare email address routing written in go.

## Why?
When I bought my domain I figured out that you could use Cloudflare's email routing feature to generate **temporary email addresses**. This way, if your email gets into the hands of advertisers, you can just revoke the address and avoid your inbox from being spammed.

*aaaand I am started learning go recently, so I wanted to create a small project to get used to the language (the first version of smokescreen was written in Java)*
